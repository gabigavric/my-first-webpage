  <h1>Some Of My Favorite Places</h1>
  <p>Most of my free time is spent outdoors, therefor; some of my favorite places are in <strong>nature</strong>!
  I like to go alone sometimes to clear my mind, or bring my dog and boyfriend with me for companionship.</p>
  <h3><u>Places I Like To Walk Around In</u></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge</li>
    <li>Forest Park</li>
    <li>Cooper Mountain Park</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The TRNWR is a flat walk, and only 3.25 miles roundtrip. Animals aren't allowed
  here so I typically go alone and catcht the sunset from the observatory after my walk.</p>

  <p>There are many entrances to forest park, otherwise known as Washington Park. This really gives me
  a feeling of being outside of the suburbs. How lucky am I to have such a place so close to me?</p>

  <p>Finally, Cooper Mountain. This is also not animal friendly, but offers a spectacular view at the entrance
  where the trails begin. But be ware, since it's all downhill , getting back up the trail will be tiring!</p>
